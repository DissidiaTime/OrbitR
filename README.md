# OrbitR
R Package
Hello and welcome to OrbitR!

OrbitR is an educational R package designed to help users simulate, visualize, and understand the orbits of planets in our solar system. It provides tools for retrieving planetary information, visualizing orbits, calculating positions, and simulating adjustments to orbital parameters.


Features

- Get Planet Information: Retrieve data about any planet in our solar system including its distance from the sun and its diameter.
- Plot Simple Orbits: Visualize the orbit of a planet using a simple circular model.
- Calculate Planet Position: Determine the current position of a planet in its orbit based on simplified models.
- Simulate Orbit Adjustments: Explore how changes in a planet's velocity could alter its orbit.
